# Case Studies
In this section we plan to explore how different services have setup the architecture to support their Lightning Network services. These case studies would give us some insights into what some of the best practices and limitations are when working with Lightning Network setups.

The studies will be broken into "mobile app" and "backend". On the "mobile app" side, we will be looking at how different apps have constructed their solutions to work around the limitations of offering Lightning Network based services within the constraints of the mobile environment. On the "backend" side, we will be looking at how different services have chosen to arrange their services and separate different areas of functionality to effectively support end-user products.

In some instances there will be a linkage from "mobile app" to "backend" for the case studies where we choose to explore both sides of a given service's offering.
